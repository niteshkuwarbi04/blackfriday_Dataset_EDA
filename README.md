# Black Friday Purchase Prediction
## Problem Statement
A retail company, ABC Private Limited, aims to understand customer purchase behavior, specifically the purchase amount, against various products of different categories. They provided a dataset containing purchase summaries of various customers for selected high-volume products from the last month. The dataset includes customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category), and the total purchase_amount from the last month.

The objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the purchase amount of customers for various products. This model will assist the company in creating personalized offers for customers against different products.

## Dataset Overview
I took the dataset from Kaggle Black Friday dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdolezel/black-friday)
The dataset includes the following information:

* Customer demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, City Type, Stay in Current City
* Product details: Product ID, Product Category
* Target Variable: Total Purchase Amount

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Black Friday dataset. Key steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Handled or removed them appropriately.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the distribution of variables, relationships between features, and visualized key insights using graphs and charts.
3. Feature Engineering: Created new relevant features to enhance the model's predictive capability.

## Model Building
Implemented a machine learning model to predict the purchase amount of customers based on the provided features. The model is designed to generalize well to new data and assist the company in making personalized offers.
